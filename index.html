          <p>The Hartford Promise is designed to empower students from Hartford, Connecticut, by providing them with the necessary resources and support to pursue higher education. Participants in this program are typically high school students from Hartford who meet specific academic and attendance criteria. Such as the following; attending a Hartford public high school continuously since 9th grade, being a Hartford resident throughout high school, having a 93% or better cumulative attendance record during high school, and having a 3.0 cumulative GPA or better on a 4.0 scale in high school. The program aims to improve access to college education for these students, many of whom might face financial or social barriers to higher education. By offering scholarships and additional support, Hartford Promise seeks to level the educational playing field, giving these students a better chance at college success. The program is a significant step towards educational equity, aiming to provide more opportunities for students who might otherwise be unable to pursue higher education due to various constraints.</p>

          <p>Our story focuses on analyzing the successful completion rates of a bachelor’s degree of Hartford Promise students at in-Connecticut colleges versus out-of-Connecticut colleges. This is significant as it helps us understand how geographic location and the type of institution impact the academic outcomes of these students. Additionally, the question seeks to explore whether the completion rate pattern varies across subgroups, such as race/ethnicity, gender, or the type of institutions they attend. Furthermore, this comparison is essential in determining the effectiveness of educational policies and support systems in Connecticut compared to other states. It is possible that students who remain in-state benefit more from the familiar environment and local support networks that lead them to have a higher successful completion rate than other states, or vice versa. Preliminary findings from an analysis of the academic outcomes of Hartford Promise students reveal a notable trend: students who attend colleges within Connecticut tend to have a higher rate of successful degree completion compared to their counterparts attending institutions outside of the state.</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>Our data came from Hartford Promise private data source that will remain anonymous. We used this data to calculate the successful completion rate and generate pivot tables and visualizations. 
The successful completion rate is determined by the percentage of students who have successfully finished their 4-year college education and obtained a bachelor's degree regardless of how long it may have taken. To calculate this, we focus on the ratio of the number of students who have earned a bachelor's degree to the total number of students who initially enrolled in the program. This metric effectively measures the effectiveness of the program in facilitating students' academic success.</p>

          <h4>Pivot Tables</h4>

          <p>After receiving the data, we conducted a pivot table that generated the total number of enrollments or starters in each state. We also broke down the data by adding 2 years and 4 years of college in the columns, which will help us see the breakdown of the total enrollment of students in 4 years of college. We used a filter to show only 1 instance, which is where students start their first semester. After this process, we noticed that the total enrollment in Connecticut was significantly higher than in the other states; therefore, we chose to express it in percentages in order to normalize the data and make meaningful comparisons. To find the number of students who completed their Bachelor’s degrees, we also created a pivot table showing the total number of degrees earned in each state, which we filtered out other types of degrees and only showed Bachelor’s degrees. These pivot tables allow us to calculate the completion rate across different states and make meaningful comparisons of the successful completion between Connecticut colleges and out-of-Connecticut colleges.</p>


          <h4>Visualization and Figures</h4>

          <p>To effectively present the educational data, we utilized two distinct bar charts. The first chart displays the number of students who commenced their degrees, offering a clear visual representation of initial enrollments. The second chart, complementing the first, showcases the count of students who successfully completed their degrees, thus providing insight into graduation rates/ completion. Additionally, we employed two choropleth maps to enrich our analysis. This map vividly illustrates the percentage of students, both those who started and those who completed their degrees, across various states in the USA. The use of color gradients in the choropleth map effectively highlights geographical variations in educational attainment, enabling an easy comparison between different regions. This combination of bar charts and a choropleth map offers a comprehensive and multifaceted view of the educational landscape in the United States, shedding light on patterns of both enrollment and completion across in-state and out-of-state.</p>
